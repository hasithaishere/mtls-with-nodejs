# A Deep Dive into Mutual TLS (mTLS) with NodeJS

This project contains source code and supporting files for a server and client application that demonstrate mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication between a client and a server. The server and client is written in NodeJS.

This is a companion project to the blog post [Securing Node.js Communication: A Deep Dive into Mutual TLS (mTLS)](https://blog.hasitha.xyz/securing-nodejs-communication-a-deep-dive-into-mutual-tls-mtls).

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and install the dependencies.

```bash
git clone
cd nodejs-mtls
npm install
```

## Running the Server

To run the server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run server
```

## Running the Client

To run the client, run the following command:

```bash
npm run client
```
